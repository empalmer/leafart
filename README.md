# Fall leaf art based on genearted trees

This package uses the process of creating generated trees in order to produce pretty leaf pictures with ggplot.

### Included folders: 

- The R folder contains functions I have coded for this project
- The topic_exploration folder contains work I've done to understand the existing state of generative art packages in R that might be relevant.
