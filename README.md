# Generative PNW Fire Art - Emily Palmer

This will be a project for generative art of PNW landscapes before/during/after forest fires.   

### Included folders: 

- The R folder (currently empty) contains functions I have coded for this project
- The topic_exploration folder contains work I've done to understand the existing state of generative art packages in R that might be relevant.
