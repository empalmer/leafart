## Test functions are working 

### Test the movable leaves work 
```{r}
# One leaf
get_gingko_params() %>% 
  full_leaf_origin() %>% 
  rake_leaves() %>% 
  plot_leaves()

# many leaves 


```

### Test the initially randomly placed and rotated leaves work

```{r}
# one leaf
get_gingko_params() %>%
  grow_leaf_random() %>% 
  rake_leaves() %>%
  plot_leaves()

# multiple leaves
get_gingko_params() %>% 
  make_the_leaves_fall() %>% 
  plot_leaves()

initialize <- tibble(
    # Choose a random first location, smaller selection for leafs falling
    x_0 = sample(1:50,1),
    y_0 = sample(1:50,1),
    x_1 = x_0, y_1 = y_0 + .5, # first shoot guide is its midpoint
    x_2 = x_0, y_2 = y_0 + 1,
    angle = sample(-180:180,1), # Random orientation of leaf orientation
    length = 1,       # initial
    iter_n = 1L       # time used for
  )
grow_leaf_layers(initialize, param)
one_branch(partial_leaf = initialize, param = param)
```




## Play with different parameter values and output plots 


```{r}

```
