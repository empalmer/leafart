## Test functions are working 

### Test the movable leaves work 
```{r}
param <- get_gingko_params(location = "origin")

# One leaf
get_gingko_params(location = "origin") %>% 
  full_leaf() %>% 
  rake_leaves() %>% 
  plot_leaves()

# many leaves 


```

### Test the initially randomly placed and rotated leaves work

```{r}
# one leaf
param <- get_gingko_params(location = "random")

get_gingko_params(location = "random") %>%
  grow_leaf() %>% 
  rake_leaves() %>%
  plot_leaves()

# multiple leaves
get_gingko_params() %>% 
  make_the_leaves_fall() %>% 
  plot_leaves()

initialize <- tibble(
    # Choose a random first location, smaller selection for leafs falling
    x0 = sample(1:50,1),
    y0 = sample(1:50,1),
    x1 = x0,
    y1 = y0 + 1,
    angle = sample(-180:180,1), # Random orientation of leaf orientation
    length = 1,       # initial
    iter_n = 1L       # time used for
  )
grow_leaf_layers(initialize, param)
one_branch(partial_leaf = initialize, param = param)


leaf <- get_gingko_params() %>%
  grow_leaf_random()
```




## Play with different parameter values and output plots 


```{r}

```
